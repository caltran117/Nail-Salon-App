# Nail Salon Appp

## Description

I would like clients to be able to book appointment through the salon app and also be able to login to the app and see the current days appointments and walk-ins that has checked in. Therefore they can schedule an appt and check if the day is busy or not for a walk-in .

Acceptance criteria:  it will be completed when we have a interface then clients can use a see it, when there is a calendar then clients can schedule, when there is a view of the current “day’s schedule” and walk-ins that checked in then they can see whether it is a good time to walk-in,  when there is a check out feature to remove or check off clients in the “day schedule” then that list will be updated

The motivation is the lack of customized nail salon apps and lack of current appointment softwares online that allow clients to see the salon's current day schedule to accomodate whether it is a good time for a walk-in to come. 

We built this project in order to build the skills required to customize a app specific to a client and learn how to work as a team as developers and to prepare us for the future. This project is also fully customizeable to each salon owner, and provide a better service to clients by through schedule and occupancy transparency. 

This solves the problem of clients having to call the salon for an appointment and also showing up to the salon when it is busy and being turned away.
